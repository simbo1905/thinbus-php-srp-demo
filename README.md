# Thinbus SRP PHP

Copyright (c) Simon Massey, 2015-2017

Thinbus SRP PHP is an implementation of the SRP-6a Secure Remote Password  protocol. It is compatible with [Thinbus](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js) a JavaScript SRP implementation. This allows you to generate a verifier for a temporary password in PHP and have users login to a PHP server using a browser. 

This PHP project is published at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/simon_massey/thinbus-php-srp). This repository also includes a slightly contrived demo of a browser running the [Thinbus Javascript library](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js) authenticating to a PHP server. 

**Note** Please read the [Thinbus documentation page](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js) before attempting to use this demo code. 

## Trying The Demo

PHP comes with a very slow [built in webserver](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) that can be used for local testing purposes:  

```sh
# Run this in the same folder as the top level demo files
php -S localhost:8000
```

This lets you try this demo with your PHP version and use browser developer tools to inspect the AJAX traffic. Note that the built in webserver is very slow compared to a real PHP server install. 

## Using In Your Application

This work is based on [Ruslan Zazvacky's SRP PHP demo](https://github.com/RuslanZavacky/srp-6a-demo) and registers users into a SQLite database. 
It is very artificial as it only uses AJAX to confirm that authentication is successful. With a real application post authentication the browser should load a main application 
page in a traditional (not AJAX) way to force the cleanup of any traces of the password as recommended on the [Thinbus page](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js). 

The core PHP library files are in the `thinbus` folder:

* `thinbus/thinbus-srp-config.php` SRP configuration global variables. Must be included before the thinbus library code. Must match the values configured in the JavaScript. 
* `thinbus/thinbus-srp.php` PHP port of the Thinbus Java SRP server code based on code by [Ruslan Zavacky](https://github.com/RuslanZavacky/srp-6a-demo).
* `thinbus/thinbus-srp-common.php` common functions used by the client and server. 
* `thinbus/BigInteger.php` pear.php.net [BigInteger math package](http://pear.php.net/package/BigInteger).
* `thinbus/srand.php` strong random numbers from [George Argyros](https://github.com/GeorgeArgyros/Secure-random-bytes-in-PHP) avoiding known buggy versions of random libraries.
* `thinbus/thinbus-srp-client.php` PHP client code contributed by Keith Wagner.     

The core Thinbus JavaScript library files are in the `resources/thinbus` folder: 

* `thinbus/rfc5054-safe-prime-config.js` A sample configuration. See the main thinbus documentation for how to create your own safe prime. 
* `thinbus/thinbus-srp6a-sha256-versioned.js` The thinbus JS library which is tested in the [main project](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js). See the header in that file which states the version. 

The file `thinbus-srp-config.php` contains the SRP constants which looks something like: 

```
$SRP6CryptoParams = [
    "N_base10" => "19502997308..."
    "g_base10" => "2",
    "k_base16" => "1a3d1769e1d..."
    "H" => "sha256"
];
```

The numeric constants must match the values configured in the JavaScript; see the [Thinbus documentation](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js). 
Consider creating your own large safe prime values using openssl using the Thinbus instructions. 

The files named above are Thinbus library code and are supported. The rest of the demo application is purely for demonstration purposes only and not 
intended to be deployed into production. The idea is that you have your own user management and user authorisation logic and you simply want to 
swap out plain text password authentication with SRP authentication. The Thinbus core library provides the cryptography and you will supply your own 
HTML, AJAX and database access logic. SRP is independent of those such things and they will be specific to your application. All you need to understand 
is that:

* Every users has a password verifier and a unique salt that you store in your database. This implementation uses the [RFC2945](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2945.txt) approach of hashing the username into the password verifier. This means that if your application lets a user change their username then they will be locked out unless you generate and store a fresh password verifier.  
* At every login attempt the browser first makes an AJAX call to get a one-time random challenge and the user salt from the server. The browser then uses that to compute a one-time proof-of-password and then immediately posts the proof-of-password to the server. The server checks the proof-of-password for the one-time challenge using the information stored in the user database. This means the server has to hold the thinbus object that generated the challenge for a short period (either your favourite cache or in your main database). 

The following diagram shows what you need to know: 

![Thinbus SRP Login Diagram](http://simonmassey.bitbucket.io/thinbus/login.png "Thinbus SRP Login Diagram")

The demo saves the use salt and verifier in an [SQLite](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite.php) flat file database at `/tmp/srp_db.txt`. The location is configured in `require.php`. 
The demo application comprises of the following top level php demo files that you probably *don't* want to use in your own application: 

* `require.php` a fragment to pull in the SRP constants, Thinbus library, RedBean library. It also initialises the SQLite database. 
* `rb.php` [RedBeanPHP](http://redbeanphp.com) "an easy-to-use, on-the-fly ORM for PHP" used to abstract the database solely for the convenience of this demo. You are not expected to use this library code in your own application.   
* `register.php` accepts a POST with the user email, salt and verifier and saves them into the SQLite database. It is expected you have your own logic for registering users and you are going to modify that to save a salt and verifier for each user rather than use this code.
* `challenge.php` accepts a POST with the user email, looks up the salt and verifier in the SQLite database, and uses Thinbus core library code to generate a one-time server challenge. It saves the Thinbus object in the SQLite database in an 'authentication' table so that it can look up everything needed to verify the client password proof based on the one-time challenge. It is expected that you don't use my SQLLite demo code but supply your own code to save things in your main database using your own code. 
* `login.php` verifies the user password proof. Note that the server needs to remember the one-time challenge that it gave the client to check the one-time password proof. It therefore looks up the object that created the one-time challenge in the SQLite database. It is expected that you don't use my SQLLite demo code but supply your own code to save things in your main database using your own code. This logic uses the core Thinbus library code to check the password proof which will throw a PHP exception if authentication fails. 

It is expected that you create your own code for loading and saving data to a real database. Do not use my SQLLite or RedBean code. Only use the PHP files at `thinbus\*.php` folder of this repo.It is expected that you use your own code for handling authorisation of which pages users can or cannot access. Trying to modifying the demo files to support your application may be harder than just modifying your current application to simply use the core Thinbus library at `thinbus\*.php`. 

Please read the recommendations in the [main thinbus documentation](https://bitbucket.org/simon_massey/thinbus-srp-js) and take additional steps such as using HTTPS and encrypting the password verifier in the database which are not shown in this demo. 

**Note:** It is *strongly* *recommended* that you install the PHP [Open SSL extention](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) which the random number generator in `srand.php` will try to use. If it cannot find that extension then it's second choice is the PHP [Mcrypt Extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php). If it cannot find that or if it is running on Windows it uses it's own random number generating approach by [George Argyros](https://github.com/GeorgeArgyros/Secure-random-bytes-in-PHP). 

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems first check that the PHP unit code runs locally on your worksation using the exact same version of PHP as you run on your server: 

```sh
# download the php phar if you don't have it installed globally and check it can print out its version
wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit.phar
# the following should be 6.4.4 or higher
php phpunit.phar --version
# run the Thinbus unit tests which tests the cryptography
php phpunit.phar ThibusTest.php
```

If all test pass should output a final line such as `OK (xx tests, yyy assertions)`. If not raise an issue with the exact PHP version and the output of `phpinfo();`

Next run the local [built in webserver](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) on your workstation and try to register then authenticate (note that successfuli authentication only writes "Success" in a green banner on the login page): 

```sh
# Run this in the same folder as the top level demo files 
php -S localhost:8000
```

If that doesn't work try a couple of different browsers (chrome, firefox, edge/safari) to check if it is a browser JavaScript compatibility problem. Use your favourite browsers developer view to look at the network traffic to see if it corresponds to the diagrams above. Supply the details of the browser traffic in any issue that you raise. 
Then raise an issue naming all the browser versions you tested with and the results. 
Bonus marks for using the browser developer tools to capture the network traffic (particularly the AJAX calls) to see if the server put any error messages 
into the traffic which may break the demo code. Further bonus marks for including any browser JS console output and any PHP scripting engine logs which may 
indicate what the problem might be.  

If you got this far and couldn't find any problems with the demo code running locally then next try deploying the demo code to your main webserver. 
Your webserver might not have permission to write to `/tmp/srp_db.txt` see the documentation above about where that is hardcoded in the demo to change it. 
If the demo works locally but doesnt work on your main server then I suggest you use the browser developer tools to compare the network traffic 
(particularly the AJAX calls) that happen when running locally verses running on your main server to see if the server traffic indicates a server configuration problem. Typically the AJAX resonpse from the server pukes up a warning message that the browser cannot parse. Try to fix the PHP warning message before raising an issue as its normally something missing from a custom PHP install. 

If the PHP code is running very slow on your server then its likely that your server is missing some native libraries that PHP normally uses. When this is the case the PHP engine runs much slower than the webbrowser. This is not something that I can debug for you so please don't raise an issue. Instead ask a question on stackoverflow or another stackexchange site about your OS and PHP version asking whether there are "known issues" of code running slowly that can be fixed by changing settings or installing native libraries. (The typical one is to install openssl and the php library which uses it.)
